    <div class="text-box">
        <h2>What did you look up?</h2>
        <p>I looked up information on the &lt;div&gt; tag.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
        <h2>What sites did you consult?</h3>
            <p> I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_div.asp">W3Schools</a>, <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/div">Mozilla</a>, <a
                    href="https://html.com/tags/div/">HTML.com</a>, and <a
                    href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-div-what-is-a-div-tag-and-how-to-style-it-with-css/">FreeCodeCamp</a>.

    <div class="text-box">
        <h2>What are the differences in the information presented on each site?
        </h2>
        <h3>W3Schools</h3>
        <p>W3Schools was overall pretty thorough on what a div tag is, how to use it, when to use it, and many other
            details about styling and formatting a &lt;div&gt; tag. There's lots of great examples with the option to
            "try it yourself". </p>

        <h3>Mozilla</h3>
        <p>Mozilla also gave a good basic description of what a &lt;div&gt; tag is and where to use. They also touched
            on some styling aspects and, more noteably, the accessibility of the &lt;div&gt; tag.</p>

        <h3>HTML.com</h3>
        <p>HTML.com provided a very brief, very generic description of a &lt;div&gt; tag. They provided no information
            on styling at all.</p>

        <h3>FreeCodeCamp</h3>
        <p>FreeCodeCamp provided a good description of a &lt;div&gt; and how to style it. They even delved more into how
            a &lt;div&gt; can be used to make artwork through styling. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
        <h2>What features do you think a code reference page should offer?</h2>
        <p>I think a <strong>good</strong> reference page should include the following features:
        <ul>
            <li>A thorough description of the code being referenced. What is it? How is it used? Where is it appropriate
                and inappropriate to use it?</li>
            <li>An example of the code being used. Both what it looks like as code and what the end result looks like.
                Bonus points for including a "try it yourself" feature.</li>
            <li>Styling options (if applicable). Doesn't need to be every single option known to man, but maybe the top
                ones that are most commonly used or are most useful.</li>
            <li>Bonus points for including the <em>accessibility</em> of the code.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <h2>Do any of your 4 resources stand out as particularly good or bad?</h2>
        <p>Overall, I think Mozilla did the best job of providing the most information both on the page and with
            links to relevant code. HTML.com was the worst. For a beginner, I think it leaves more questions than
            answers with no additional navigation options to learn more besides their search bar. Which if I knew
            nothing about code, I probably wouldn't even know what to search for.
        <h3>Ranking the 4 sites I used from best to worst:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mozilla &starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;</li>
            <li>W3Schools &starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&#11242;</li>
            <li>FreeCodeCamp &starf;&starf;&starf;&star;&star;</li>
            <li>HTML.com &starf;&star;&star;&star;&star; </li>
        </ol>
