    <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
    <p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Non-Semantic Tags</strong> </dt>
        <dd>Tell us nothing about its content</dd>
        <dt><strong>Semantic Tags</strong></dt>
        <dd>Explicitly tell us about its content.</dd>
    </dl>
    Some examples of non-semantic tags include:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> as it does not clearly describe what the content is but is rather used for
            styling and formatting.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong> as it does not define the content, but it is also useful for styling</li>
    </ul>
    Some examples of semantic tags include:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong> because it tells us the content is the header</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;figcaption&gt;</strong> because it tells us that the content is a caption for &lt;figure&gt;
            element</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
    <p>Semantic tags are incredibly helpful because they help clue in on what the content is. Is this a header? A
        footer? A caption? An article? Without semantic tags it can be very difficult to understand what area of code
        you are working on or looking at. Another benefit is that semenatic tags improve accessiblity of the content.
        Screen readers and assistive technology rely on the semantic tags to understand how the content is structured.
