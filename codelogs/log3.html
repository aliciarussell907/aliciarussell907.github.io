    <h1>Code Log 3: CSS Media Queries</h1>

    <div class="text-box">
        <h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
        <p>Media queries work by setting code and styles based on the browser and device environment. It is a key
            component to responsive design that is very necessary in today's world. There are a plethora of different
            devices people use to view webpages and apps and it is vital to make sure that every device can view them in
            the best way possible. Being able to set certain conditions or styles based on viewport is vital to creating
            a great experience for every viewer, regardless of their preferred device.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
        <h2>What "media features" are supported by media queries — such as "orientation" or "max-width" — and what do
            they do?</h2>
        <h3>"orientation"</h3>
        <p>Orientation can change the code and styles depending on the orientation of the device. For example, landscape
            versus portrait. Maybe a header needs to be wider or shorter to look better in a landscape view versus a
            portrait view. This media query would allow the style to change depending on the orientation of the user's
            screen.
            <hr>
        </p>
        <h3>"max-width"</h3>
        <p>Max-width can change the code and styles based on the width of the viewport (screen). Specifically, it will
            apply to all screen sizes below the determined threshold. This is most commonly used in the "desktop first"
            approach to responsive design.</p>
            <hr>
        <h3>"hover"</h3>
        <p>Hover allows the user the ability to hover over an element. For example, a user could hover their mouse over
            a link and the link could change font color in response. This media query does require that the device has
            the ability to use some kind of pointing device.</p>
            <hr>
        <h3>"and"</h3>
        <p>"And" in a media query allows the combination of media features. An example could be <textarea cols="50"
                rows="2">@media screen and (width >= 600px) and (orientation: landscape)</textarea>. This would change
            code style for a device that is greater than 600px wide and is in a landscape orientation. </p>
