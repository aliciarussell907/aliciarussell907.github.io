            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>50 grams active starter</li>
                <li>350 grams warm (not hot) water</li>
                <li>10 grams of table salt</li>
                <li>500 grams of bread flour</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine active starter with water in a large mixing bowl until uniform. Then add in the flour and
                    salt. To combine you can use a spatula, but it is easier to use your hands. Dough will look shaggy
                    when combined. Cover the bowl and allow to rest for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Once the dough is finished resting, wet your hands and pick up the dough on one side to strech it
                    and
                    then fold it over onto itself. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and repeat the stretch and fold process
                    until you have turned the bowl a complete 360 degrees. The dough should form into a tight ball.
                    Cover the bowl, allow to rest for another 30 minutes, then repeat this process one more time. </li>
                <li>After completing the stretch and fold process twice, cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise for
                    7-10 hours at room temperature. You will know the dough is ready for the next step when it has risen
                    50-75%.</li>
                <li>Take the dough out of the bowl and onto a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into a ball, then
                    gently
                    cup the dough while pulling and twisting towards yourself. This will help form a tight skin on the
                    ball of dough. Transfer the dough to a parchment lined bowl. Cover the bowl and allow dough to rest
                    for 1-2 hours at room temperature.</li>
                <li>About 30 minutes before you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit with the
                    dutch oven you will use to bake the dough inside the oven. Once preheated, carefully remove the
                    dutch oven. You can score the dough now if you wish, but it is not necessary. Then place the dough
                    inside the dutch oven, using the parchment paper as sling to transfer from the bowl. Place the lid
                    on the Dutch oven and place into the oven to bake. Bake with the lid on for 20 minutes, then remove
                    lid and continue to bake the bread for another 25-30 minutes until crust is golden brown.</li>
                <li>Once done baking, remove the bread from the oven and allow to cool for at least one hour before
                    slicing. This is the hardest step, but it is worth the wait. The bread continues to cook during this
                    cooling period and allows for the best texture.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
