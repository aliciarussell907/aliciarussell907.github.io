        <button type="button" class="collapsible">How can I order one of your products?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ordering a product from NestCraft 3D is as simple as filling out our <a href="order-request.html">order
                    request form</a>. We have our customers request their order because each piece is specially printed
                for you! We do not keep an inventory in stock to allow our customers to customized their pieces for an
                affordable price.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">I filled out the order request form, but it never asked for payment?
            How do I pay?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>No need to fear! You will receive an invoice from us within two business days after submitting your
                request. If you have not received your invoice in that timeframe, please check your email's "junk" or
                "spam" folder. If you still cannot find it, please do not hesitate to <a href="contact-us.html">contact
                    us directly.</a></p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Why do can't I just pay for the order right away? Why do you have to
            send an invoice?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Because our product is not printed until after an order has been requested, we have to make sure we have
                enough material for any customizations. We do our best to keep plenty of filament on hand, but sometimes
                we get an unexpected influx of custom orders. In the event this happens, we will reach out to you the
                option to wait for our filament to be restocked or offer a different filament which may affect the total
                price.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Your products are listed as printed with "eco-friendly PLA". What is
            that?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>PLA refers to the plant-based bioplastic filament we use to print our products with. It is made from
                renewable resources (like corn starch) which reduces our reliance on fossil fuels and petroleum-based
                plastics. We use this in all our products to help better protect the Earth on which all our nests
                reside.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">You don't have many products available, will you be getting more
            designs?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>We're still a small business and are in the process of getting rid of old, out-dated designs in favor for
                new ones that will provide even more functionality and joy for your nest. Jordan Maseko (our design
                specialist) has recently joined the team and has curated many new
                and exciting designs for us to bring to you! We are in the final stages of thoroughly testing each
                design
                to ensure it is stands up to the high standards you have come to know and expect from NestCraft 3D. You
                can
                catch a sneak peek of these designs at the bottom of our <a href="all-products.html">products page</a>
                in
                the "Coming Soon" section. These designs are expected to be launch in early 2026, so be sure to check
                back soon!</p>
