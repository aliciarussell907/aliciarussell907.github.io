            <h2>Let's take it to the beginning...</h2>
            <p> In 2019, <a href="meet-the-team.html">Riley</a> (our founder) bought her first 3D printer just for fun.
                When COVID sent everyone into social distancing, Riley began making a range of gifts and
                gadgets for her family and friends to stay connected in times of social distancing and add a little
                brightness to their days. Soon her friends began urging her to start a business selling her 3D printed
                home decor. <br>
                <br>
                Riley took the first leap in late 2021 by selling her 3D printed pieces at craft fairs--each piece still
                made with
                immense love and care. By 2022, a local business
                asked if they could also sell her pieces in their storefront. Riley happily agreed, but it wasn't long
                until she realized this operation was becoming overwhelming for a team of one.

            <h2>The team grew...</h2>
            <p>In June of 2023, Riley happily welcomed <a href="meet-the-team.html">Lena</a> to the team. Lena took
                care of all the administrative and social media aspects of NestCraft 3D while Riley continued working
                behind the printer. During a local craft fair in 2024, Riley met <a href="meet-the-team.html">Jordan</a>
                who wowed her with his eye for design. It wasn't long before he was invited to join the NestCraft 3D
                team. With a team of three, it was easier to manange day-to-day operations. So then we decided to
                take the next step and expand. </p>

            <h2>We launched our website...</h2>
            <p>In 2025, we decided to take our business nationwide and offer our products online. With this big step, we
                have been completely overhauling our process and designs offered. We still sell pre-printed designs in
                our local boutique and at crafts fairs, but our online orders are all printed to order allowing for a
                wider range of customizations. Our selection may be limited now, but we have big plans in store for next
                year! Thank you for all your continued support through our journey.</p>
